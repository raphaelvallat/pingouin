ANOVA
-----

.. figure::  /pictures/flowchart/flowchart_one_way_ANOVA.svg
  :align: center
  :alt: ANOVA

Example code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

  import pingouin as pg

  # Load an example dataset comparing pain threshold as a function of hair color
  df = pg.read_dataset('anova')

  # 1. This is a between subject design, so the first step is to test for equality of variances
  pg.homoscedasticity(data=df, dv='Pain threshold', group='Hair color')

  # 2. If the groups have equal variances, we can use a regular one-way ANOVA
  pg.anova(data=df, dv='Pain threshold', between='Hair color')

  # 3. If there is a main effect, we can proceed to post-hoc Tukey test
  pg.pairwise_tukey(data=df, dv='Pain threshold', between='Hair color')

Correlation

Example code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

  import pingouin as pg
  import seaborn as sns

  # Load an example dataset with the personality scores of 500 participants
  df = pg.read_dataset('pairwise_corr')

  # 1.Test for bivariate normality (optional)
  pg.multivariate_normality(df[['Neuroticism', 'Openness']])

  # 1bis. Visual inspection with a histogram + scatter plot (optional)
  sns.jointplot(data=df, x='Neuroticism', y='Openness', kind='reg')

  # 2. If the data have a bivariate normal distribution and no clear outlier(s), we can use a regular Pearson correlation
  pg.corr(df['Neuroticism'], df['Openness'], method='pearson')

Non-parametric
--------------

.. figure::  /pictures/flowchart/flowchart_nonparametric.svg
  :align: center
  :alt: Non-parametric tests

Example code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

  import pingouin as pg

  # Load an example dataset comparing pain threshold as a function of hair color
  df = pg.read_dataset('anova')

  # There are 4 independent groups in our dataset, we'll therefore use the Kruskal-Wallis test:
  pg.kruskal(data=df, dv='Pain threshold', between='Hair color')
