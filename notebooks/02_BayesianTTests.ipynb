    "In this tutorial we will see how to compute a classical and Bayesian T-test in Pingouin using the [ttest](https://pingouin-stats.org/generated/pingouin.ttest.html#pingouin.ttest) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used in Pingouin is derived from [Rouder et al. 2009](http://pcl.missouri.edu/sites/default/files/Rouder.bf_.pdf) and uses the recommended Cauchy prior distribution on effect size, centered around 0 and with a width (r) factor of 0.707. This default values applies well for most cases (at least for psychological studies with typically small to moderate effect sizes).\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, it means that you expect (i.e. your prior) that the effect size will most likely fall between -.707 and +.707. Note that this parameter can be adjusted by using the `r` optional argument function. Use smaller values if you expect smaller effect sizes, and larger values if you expect larger effect sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this example, we will generate a fake drug / placebo study with 30 subjects in each group.\n",
    "We are interested in comparing the memory performances after administration of the drug or the placebo."
